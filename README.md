## About this project
Realistic cloth simulation is important in many fields such as film industry, computer game and VR shopping. In this project, an implicit Euler method is implemented to integrate the mass-spring system. Compared to explicit method, implicit method is more stable and allows larger time step. 

## Features
- Strain constraint
- Bending constraint
- Lighting
- Camera control
- Collision (simple)
- Drag the cloth

## Environment
- Visual Studio
- QT
- OpenGl (Glad)
- GLM (for math computation)
- Eigen (solve sparse linear equations)
